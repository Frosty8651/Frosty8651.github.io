  My name is Sam Frost and I come from Buffalo, NY. I went to Sweet Home High School and I aspire to some day work at Nintendo. 
  I love playing video games, mostly on my Nintendo Switch, but I do plan on getting the Playstation 5 when that comes out. 
  I'm also really into music, some of my favorite bands include My Chemical Romance, Paramore, Weezer, System of a Down and Green Day.
  I've been playing guitar for about two and a half years and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon!
